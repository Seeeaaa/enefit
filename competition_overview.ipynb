    "The goal of the competition is to create an energy prediction model of prosumers to reduce energy imbalance costs. This competition aims to tackle the issue of energy imbalance, a situation where the energy expected to be used doesn't line up with the actual energy used or produced. Prosumers, who both consume and generate energy, contribute a large part of the energy imbalance. Despite being only a small part of all consumers, their unpredictable energy use causes logistical and financial problems for the energy companies."

    "- **Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of prosumers is rapidly increasing, and solving the problems of energy imbalance and their rising costs is vital. If left unaddressed, this could lead to increased operational costs, potential grid instability, and inefficient use of energy resources. If this problem were effectively solved, it would significantly reduce the imbalance costs, improve the reliability of the grid, and make the integration of prosumers into the energy system more efficient and sustainable. Moreover, it could potentially incentivize more consumers to become prosumers, knowing that their energy behavior can be adequately managed, thus promoting renewable energy production and use."

    "Enefit is one of the biggest energy companies in Baltic region. As experts in the field of energy, we help customers plan their green journey in a personal and flexible manner as well as implement it by using environmentally friendly energy solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "At present, Enefit is attempting to solve the imbalance problem by developing internal predictive models and relying on third-party forecasts. However, these methods have proven to be insufficient due to their low accuracy in forecasting the energy behavior of prosumers. The shortcomings of these current methods lie in their inability to accurately account for the wide range of variables that influence prosumer behavior, leading to high imbalance costs. By opening up the challenge to the world's best data scientists through the Kaggle platform, Enefit aims to leverage a broader pool of expertise and novel approaches to improve the accuracy of these predictions and consequently reduce the imbalance and associated costs."
